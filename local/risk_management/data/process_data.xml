                    Planning Risk Management is the process of defining how to conduct risk management activities. The
                   key benefit of this process is it ensures that the degree, type, and visibility of risk management
                   are commensurate with both the risk and the size of the Organisation. The risk management plan is
                   vital to communicate with and obtain agreement and support from all stakeholders to ensure the risk
                   management process is supported and performed effectively across the organization.
